# HHBQP
**Hybrid Heuristics for Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming**

This heuristic algorithm were automatically generated using the [AutoBQP](https://github.com/souzamarcelo/AutoBQP) solver. The automated algorithm design process and the HHBQP algorithm are detailed in the following article (see AAC_R algorithm).
